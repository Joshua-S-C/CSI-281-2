1  : O(n). It's looping through the array of size n, once.
2  : O(n). Linear search is O(n), just O(n) because that's the most significant factor.
3  : 32 searches
linear search = 5 instructions * n * numOfSearches
binary search = 10 instructions * log (n) [binary search] * numOfsearches + ( 12 * n * log(n) ) [sort]
Intersection of the two as functions is 31.XX, so at 32 searches it is worth binary searching.

4  : Struct, class, vector, array
