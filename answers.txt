1  : O(n). It's looping through the array of size n, once.
2  : O(n). Linear search is O(n), just O(n) because that's the most significant factor.
3  : answer:
32 searches
linear search = 5 instructions * numOfElements * numOfSearches
binary search = 10 instructions * log (elements) [spd of binary search
+] * numOfsearches + sort instructions [ 12 * N * log(N) ]
